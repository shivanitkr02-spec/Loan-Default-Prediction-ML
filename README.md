# Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict loan default risk using historical credit data. The objective is to support data-driven credit risk assessment and lending decisions in financial institutions.

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Business Impact
- Identifies high-risk borrowers before loan approval
- Helps reduce loan default losses
- Improves credit decision accuracy using predictive analytics

## Dataset
Dataset sourced from Kaggle (loan default / credit risk dataset).
